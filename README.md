# Calculator-Android

This App is currently just a very basic calculator and is being created to help teach myself the basics of Android development. I plan on adding more functionality and utility as I grow my knowledge base.

Currently in a very ugly state (I'm new at this give me a break) but can handle basic I/O. Still need to include input sanitization and error handling.
